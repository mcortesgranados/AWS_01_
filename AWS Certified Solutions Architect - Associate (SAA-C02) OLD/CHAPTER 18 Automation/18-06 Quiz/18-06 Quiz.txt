What best describes "immutable pattern" for application code deployments?

Deployment of application code can't modify existing cloud resources, requiring creation of new resources.

Correct Answer
The immutable pattern specifies a deployment of application code by starting an entirely new set of servers with a new configuration or version of application code. When we go immutable, we don't want to ever upgrade in place. Once the cloud resource exists, it can't be modified. Reference Documentation: Immutable and Blue/Green Deployment.
