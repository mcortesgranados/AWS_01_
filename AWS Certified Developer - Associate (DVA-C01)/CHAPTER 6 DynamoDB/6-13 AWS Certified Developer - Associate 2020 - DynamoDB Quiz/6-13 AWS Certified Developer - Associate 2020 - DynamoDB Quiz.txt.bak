What is the difference between a Global Secondary Index and a Local Secondary Index

You can create a Global Secondary Index at any time but you can only create a Local Secondary Index at table creation time
You can delete a Global Secondary Index at any time

Only Global secondary Indexes can be created or deleted at anytime. Local Secondary Indexes must be created when you first create the table and they cannot be modified or deleted.

You have an application that needs to read 25 items per second and each item is 13KB in size. Your application uses strongly consistent reads. What should you set the read throughput to?

100

Each Read Capacity unit represents 1 x 4KB Strongly Consistent Read. 13 / 4 = 3.25 rounded up to 4KB multiply by 25 = 100.

_________________________________________________________________________________

A user would like to use the AWS CLI to get the attributes for an item with a specific primary key stored in a DynamoDB table. In order to do this, they will need IAM permissions for which of the following?

GetItem

GetItem returns a set of attributes for an item with the given primary key.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following are ways of remediating a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded error from DynamoDB?

Exponential Backoff
Reduce the frequency of requests to the DynamoDB table

ProvisionedThroughputExceeded means that your request rate is too high. Reduce the frequency of requests using Error Retries and Exponential Backoff.

_________________________________________________________________________________

In order to address performance considerations and achieve faster response times, which of the following best practices can be used for Querying and Scanning Data in Amazon DynamoDB large tables?

Reduce the page size to return fewer items per results page.
Run parallel scans if the table size is 20 GB or larger, the table's provisioned read throughput is not being fully used, and sequential Scan operations are too slow.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Your application is storing customer order data in DynamoDB. Which of the following pairs of attributes would make the best composite key to allow you to query DynamoDB efficiently to find a customer order that was placed on a specific day?

CustomerID + OrderDate

To find an order placed on a specific date, use CustomerID and OrderDate as the composite key.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Your DynamoDB table is throwing a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded error, what could be the problem?

Your application's request rate is too high

ProvisionedThroughputExceededException means that your application is sending more requests to the DynamoDB table than the provisioned read / write capacity can handle.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following attributes wouldn't make a good partition key?

InvoiceDate

High-cardinality attributes are recommended for DynamoDB partition keys. These are attributes that have distinct values for each item, like e-mailid, employee_no, customerid, sessionid, orderid, and so on. InvoiceDate provides low-cardinality since many values are repeated for such attribute. Reference: Choosing the Right DynamoDB Partition Key.

_________________________________________________________________________________

In DynamoDB, a scan operation is used to:

Return all data attributes for every item in the table or index

A Scan operation in Amazon DynamoDB reads every item in a table or a secondary index. By default, a Scan operation returns all of the data attributes for every item in the table or index. You can use the ProjectionExpression parameter so that Scan only returns some of the attributes, rather than all of them. Working with Scans in DynamoDB.

You have an application which reads 80 items of data every second. Each item consists of 3KB. Your application uses eventually consistent reads. What should you set the RCU read throughput to?

40 RCU

Correct Answer
Each Read Capacity Unit represents 2 x Eventually consistent 4KB reads per second. 3KB / 4KB = 0.75 and round up to 1. Multiply that by 80 to give you the figure for Strongly consistent reads. Divide that by 2 to get Eventually consistent reads. Therefore the answer is 40 RCU.

Your low latency web application needs to store its session state in a scalable way so that it can be accessed quickly. Which service do you recommend?

DynamoDB

Using DynamoDB for session storage alleviates issues that occur with session handling in a distributed web application by moving sessions off of the local file system and into a shared location. Amazon DynamoDB provides an effective solution for sharing session state across web servers without incurring drawbacks. Reference: Managing ASP.NET Session State with Amazon DynamoDB.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following DynamoDB API calls is used to add a new item into a DynamoDB table?

PutItem

PutItem adds a new item into a table or replaces an old item with a new one.

DynamoDB is a No-SQL database provided by AWS.

True

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following services provides in-memory write-through cache optimized for DynamoDB?

DAX

DAX or DynamoDB Accelerator is highly available, in-memory cache which is optimized for DynamoDB. DAX currently only offers write-through cache. ElastiCache is supported for use with DynamoDB, however it is not specifically optimized for use with DynamoDB. CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network which caches content like files, web pages, videos etc, but cannot be used to cache Database data. Read-Replicas are used to scale read operations for RDS instances.


_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following attributes would make a good Partition Key?

ProductID

It is good practice to use high-cardinality attributes for Partition Keys. in other words, attributes with values that are very uncommon or unique. e.g. ID number, email address, phone number, Social Security Number etc.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which of the following approaches is used in AWS to improve flow control by retrying failed requests using progressively longer waits between retries?

Exponential Backoff

Each AWS SDK implements an exponential backoff algorithm for better flow control. The idea behind exponential backoff is to use progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses.

_________________________________________________________________________________

By default, a DynamoDB query operation is used for which of the following?

Find items in a table based on the partition key attribute

A query finds items based on the partition key, whereas a scan returns the entire contents of a table. Query.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which feature can you use to capture a time-ordered sequence of all the activity which occurs on your DynamoDB table - e.g. insert, update, delete?

DynamoDB Streams

DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real time. Change Data Capture for DynamoDB Streams.

_________________________________________________________________________________

You have an application that needs to read 25 items per second and each item is 13KB in size. Your application uses eventually consistent reads. What should you set the read throughput to?

50 RCU

Each Read Capacity unit represents 1 x 4KB Strongly Consistent Read. 13KB / 4KB = 3.25 rounded up to 4 multiply by 25 = 100 which gives you the figure for Strongly consistent reads. Divide that by 2 for Eventually consistent. So the answer is 50 RCU.

_________________________________________________________________________________

What does the error "ProvisionedThroughputExceededException" mean in DynamoDB?

You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput for a table or for one or more global secondary indexes.

This error means that you have exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput for a table or for one or more global secondary indexes.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Which DynamoDB feature can be used to define an expiry date and time for a data record in your table?

TTL

TTL or Time To Live is used to set an expiry time on your record

_________________________________________________________________________________

Your application is storing customer order data in a DynamoDB table. You need to run a query to find all the orders placed by a specific customer in the last month, which attributes would you use in your query?

The Partition Key of CustomerID and a Sort Key of OrderDate

CustomerName is unlikely to be a unique value in the database, CustomerID is a better choice as will be a unique value. To identify all the orders placed in the last month by a customer, use OrderDate as the Sort Key. The Partition Key of CustomerID would also be more unique than CustomerName.

_________________________________________________________________________________

You have a motion sensor which writes 600 items of data every minute. Each item consists of 5KB. What should you set the write throughput to?

50

One write request unit represents one write for an item up to 1 KB in size. If you write 600 items every minute, it means 10 items are written per second ( 600 / 60 ). The total number of write capacity units required depends on the item size. If your item size is 5 KB, just multiply 10 items by 5 KB, so you require 50 write capacity units to sustain one write request. Read/Write Capacity Mode.

Using the AWS Console, you are trying to scale DynamoDB past its pre-configured maximums. Which service limits can you increase by raising a ticket to AWS support?

Provisioned throughput limits
Global Secondary Indexes per table

AWS places some default quotas on the throughput you can provision. These are the quotas unless you request a higher amount. To request a service quota increase, see https://aws.amazon.com/support. Reference: Service, Account, and Table Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB

There is an initial quota of 20 global secondary indexes per table. To request a service quota increase, see https://aws.amazon.com/support. Reference: Service, Account, and Table Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB
