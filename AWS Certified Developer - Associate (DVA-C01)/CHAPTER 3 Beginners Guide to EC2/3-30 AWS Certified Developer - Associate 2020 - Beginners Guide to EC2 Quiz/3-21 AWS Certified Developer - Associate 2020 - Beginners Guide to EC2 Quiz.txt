You work for a web analytics firm who have recently migrated their application to AWS. The application sits behind an Elastic Load Balancer and it monitors user traffic to their website. You have noticed that in the application logs you are no longer seeing your users public IP addresses, instead you are seeing the private IP address of the elastic load balancer. This data is critical for your business and you need to rectify the issue immediately. What should you do?

Update the application to log the x-forwarded-for header to get your users public IPv4 addresses.

Correct. Your access logs capture the IP address of your load balancer because the load balancer establishes the connection to your instances. You must perform additional configuration to capture the IP addresses of clients in your access logs. For Application Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers with HTTP/HTTPS listeners, you must use X-Forwarded-For headers to capture client IP addresses. Then, you must print those client IP addresses in your access logs. Reference: How do I capture client IP addresses in my ELB access logs?

You have a three-tier web application with a web server tier, application tier, and database tier. The application is spread across multiple availability zones for redundancy and is in an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of two and a maximum size of ten. The application relies on connecting to an RDS Multi-AZ database. When new instances are launched, they download a connection string file that is saved in an encrypted S3 bucket using a bootstrap script. During a routine scaling event, you notice that your new web servers are failing their health checks and are not coming into service. You investigate and discover that the web server's S3 read-only role has no policies attached to it. What combination of steps should you take to remediate this problem while maintaining the principle of least privilege?

Leave the healthy instances as they are and allow new instances to come into service after fixing the policy issue.
Attach the S3 â€“ read-only policy to the role.

New instances can download a connection string, provided that the read-only policy is attached to the role. Instances will not download the connection string file without the S3 policy since it is required to allow the bootstrapping process to complete successfully.

The read-only policy attached to the role will solve the permission issue and is in line with the principle of least privilege.

You run the internal intranet for a corporate bank. The intranet consists of a number of web servers and single relational database running Microsoft SQL Server. Your peak demand occurs at 9am every week morning when users are first logging in to the intranet. They can only log in using the company's internal network and it is not possible to access the intranet from any location other than within the office building for security purposes. Management is considering a change and to move this environment to AWS where users will be able to access the intranet via a software VPN. You have been asked to evaluate a migration to AWS and to identify the best EC2 billing model for your company's intranet. You must keep costs low and to be able to scale at particular times of day. You must maintain availability of the intranet throughout office hours. Management do not want to be locked into any contracts in case for some reason they want to go back to hosting internally. What EC2 billing model should you recommend?

On-demand.

Correct. On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. On-demand instances satisfy the requirements of: low cost, availability during office hours and no lock in contracts. Dedicated instances are more costly, Reserved instances are a long term (1 to 3 year) commitment, and spot instances may terminate at any time so do not meet the availability requirements.

You have a WordPress site hosted on EC2 with a MySQL database hosted on RDS. The majority of your traffic is read traffic. There is only write traffic when you create a new blog. One of your blogs has gone viral and your WordPress site is struggling to cope. You check your CloudWatch metrics and notice your RDS instance is at 100% CPU utilization. What two steps should you take to reduce the CPU utilization?

Create an ElastiCache cluster and use this to cache your most frequently read blog posts.
Create multiple RDS read replicas and point multiple EC2 instances to these read replicas, thereby spreading the load.

Correct. Amazon ElastiCache improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from a fast, managed, in-memory system, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
Correct. Amazon RDS Read Replicas make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.

A new CIO joins your company and implements a new company policy that all EC2 EBS backed instances must have encryption at rest. What is the quickest and easiest way to apply this policy to your existing EC2 EBS backed instances?

Create a snapshot of the EC2 volume. Then create a copy of the snapshot, checking the box to enable encryption. Create an AMI of the copied snapshot and then redeploy the EC2 instance using the encrypted AMI. Delete the old EC2 instance.

Correct. Although there is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot, you can encrypt them by creating either a volume or a snapshot.

Your company has a web application on AWS. The application computes thousands of algorithms per second and is very CPU and disk intensive. The application runs on a c4.8xlarge, the largest C class instance available. The application stores its data locally on a General Purpose SSD (gp2) disk. Your application starts to perform slow. You check the logs and notice that your disk I/O is routinely reaching 16,000 IOPS. What should you do to remediate the issue?

Migrate the EBS volume from a standard EBS volume to a provisioned IOPS EBS volume.

EBS provisioned IOPS is suitable for I/O-intensive, NoSQL, and relational databases, delivering up to 64,000 IOPS per volume.

You work for an online gaming store which has a global worldwide leader board for players of the game. You need to implement a caching system for your leader board that has multiple availability zones in order to prevent an outage. Which ElastiCache solution should you use?

Redis

Correct. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis supports both Redis cluster and non-cluster modes and provides high availability via support for automatic failover by detecting primary node failures and promoting a replica to be primary with minimal impact. It allows for read availability for your application by supporting read replicas (across availability zones), to enable the reads to be served when the primary is busy with the increased workload.

You have an EC2 instance in a single availability zone connected to an RDS instance. The EC2 instance needs to communicate to S3 to download some important configuration files from it. You try the command aws s3 cp s3://yourbucket /var/www/html however you receive an error message. You log in to Identity Access Management (IAM) and discover there is no role created to allow EC2 to communicate to S3. You create the role and attach it to the existing EC2 instance. How fast will the changes take to propagate?

Almost immediately.

Correct. You can change the permissions on the IAM role associated with a running instance, and the updated permissions take effect almost immediately.

You have a very popular blog site, which has recently had a surge in traffic. You want to implement an ElastiCache solution to help take the load off the production database and you want to keep it as simple as possible. You will need to scale your cache horizontally and object caching will be your primary goal. Which ElastiCache solution will best suit your needs?

Memcached

Correct. The Memcached engine supports partitioning your data across multiple nodes. Because of this, Memcached clusters scale horizontally easily. For this scenario we do not require advanced data structure support, only object caching and horizontal scaling - so Redis is incorrect. Couchbase and ArangoDB are not supported by ElastiCache, so these are incorrect.

You work for a government contractor who supply services that are critical to national security. Because of this your corporate IT policy states that no multi-tenant virtualization is authorized within the company. Despite this, they are interested in moving to AWS, but they cannot violate corporate IT policy. Which EC2 billing model would you recommend that they use to achieve this?

Dedicated Instances.

Correct. Dedicated instances run on its own dedicated hardware, solely belonging to that customer, and they do not share resources.

You are a developer for a genomics firm that is moving its infrastructure to AWS. Their environment consists of a three-tier web application, a web tier, an application tier and a relational database tier. They have a separate fleet of virtual machines that are used to access large HPC clusters on the fly. Their lab researchers run multiple projects simultaneously and they will need to launch and decommission 1,000's of nodes on-demand while reducing the time required to complete genomic sequencing from weeks to days. In order to stay competitive they need to do this at as low cost as possible, with no long-term contracts. These HPC clusters can run any time day or night and their workloads store information in S3, so the instances can be terminated at any time without any effect on the data. What is the most COST EFFECTIVE EC2 pricing model for their requirements?

Spot Instances.

Correct. Amazon EC2 Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud and are the lowest cost option for on-demand and short term capacity requirements. As the HPC cluster nodes store the data in S3 the termination of Spot instances will not impact the data processing. Both on-demand and dedicated instances are more expensive than Spot instances, and reserved instances are for long running applications (1 to 3 years) so are not suitable for this HPC cluster scenario.

Which of the following services can be used to securely store confidential information like credentials and license codes so that they can be accessed by EC2 instances?

Systems Manager Parameter Store

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, and license codes as parameter values.

______________________________________________________________________

You see a "timed out" error when using the AWS CLI to list all the files in an S3 bucket containing thousands of files. What could be the reason for this?

Too many results are being returned which is causing the command to time out.

Using the AWS CLI to list all the files in an S3 bucket containing thousands of files can cause your API call to exceed the maximum allowed time for the AWS CLI, and generate a "timed out" error. To avoid this, you can use the --page-size option to specify that the AWS CLI request a smaller number of items from each call to the AWS service.

Individual EC2 instances are provisioned --------

In Availability Zones

Correct. When provisioning an instance you must choose which Availability Zone the instance will belong to.

______________________________________________________________________

In order to enable encryption at rest using EC2 and Elastic Block Store, you must -------

Configure encryption when creating the EBS volume

Correct. When you create a new, empty EBS volume, you can encrypt it by enabling encryption for the specific volume creation operation.

You are the IT manager at a furniture retailer and they are considering moving their web application to AWS. They currently colocate their servers in a co-location facility and the contract for this facility is now coming to an end. Management are comfortable signing a 3 year contract and want to get the cheapest web servers as possible while still maintaining availability. Their traffic is very steady and predictable. What EC2 pricing model would you recommend to maintain availability and to get the lowest cost price available?

Reserved Instances.

Correct. A Reserved Instance (RI) is an EC2 offering that provides you with a significant discount on EC2 usage when you commit to a one-year or three-year term.

You work for a media production company that streams popular TV shows to millions of users. They are migrating their web application from an in house solution to AWS. They will have a fleet of over 10,000 web servers to meet the demand and will need a reliable layer 4 load balancing solution capable of handling millions of requests per second. What AWS load balancing solution would best suit their needs?

Network Load Balancer.

Correct. Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
